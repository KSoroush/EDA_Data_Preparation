Exploratory Data Analysis with Python

Primary stages of data analysis of all raw tabular data sets are common. Python data science libraries help data analysts/data scientists considerably to pass these stages. The dataset of this exercise was provided by: kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aungpyaeap/supermarket-sales)

In a nutshell, the dataset contains historical records of sales data in 3 different supermarkets. The code blocks were written in a Jupyter notebook, but can be run in any other environments. I hope this EDA helps the data analysts save some time for other stages of analysis.
